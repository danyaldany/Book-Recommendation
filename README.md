# üìö Semantic Book Recommender

A powerful semantic book recommender system built with LangChain, HuggingFace embeddings, and Gradio. The system allows users to get book recommendations based on a textual description, category, and emotional tone. It leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to provide relevant book suggestions from a dataset of books with categorized emotions.

## üöÄ Features

* **Semantic Search**: Recommends books based on a query description by comparing semantic similarity to the dataset.
* **Category Filtering**: Allows filtering books by categories such as Fiction, Non-fiction, Mystery, etc.
* **Tone-based Filtering**: Recommends books based on emotions like Happy, Sad, Surprising, etc., using tone categorization in the dataset.
* **Gradio Interface**: Easy-to-use web-based interface for interacting with the recommender system.

## üì¶ Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you'll need the following installed:

* Python 3.x
* `pip` (for installing dependencies)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/semantic-book-recommender.git
   cd semantic-book-recommender
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**

   * Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
   * Add any required environment variables (e.g., API keys or configurations).

   Example:

   ```
   API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

5. **Prepare the dataset:**

   * Place the `books_with_emotions.csv` and `tagged_description.txt` in the project directory or modify the file paths in the code to match your file locations.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

1. **Run the application:**
   To start the Gradio app, run the following command:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Interacting with the Interface:**

   * You can enter a textual description of a book (e.g., "A story about forgiveness").
   * Select a category from the dropdown (e.g., "Fiction").
   * Choose an emotional tone (e.g., "Happy") to filter recommendations by mood.
   * Click on the "Recommend" button to get book suggestions based on your input.

3. **Results:**

   * The recommended books will be displayed as images with titles, author names, and a truncated description.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Code Overview

* **TextLoader**: Loads the textual description file (`tagged_description.txt`) containing book descriptions.
* **CharacterTextSplitter**: Splits the loaded text into smaller chunks for better processing and search performance.
* **Chroma**: The vector database used for storing book descriptions and performing semantic search.
* **HuggingFaceEmbeddings**: Embedding model used to convert text into vectors for similarity search.
* **Gradio**: Web interface for user interaction, where users can input a description, select category and tone, and get book recommendations.

## üìä Dataset

This project uses the `books_with_emotions.csv` dataset, which contains information about books and their emotional attributes (e.g., joy, surprise, anger, sadness, etc.). The `tagged_description.txt` file contains book descriptions for the similarity-based search.
